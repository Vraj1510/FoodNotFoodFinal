# Food Image Classifier App üçîüçé

This project is a Python application designed to classify images as either food or non-food using the Food 5K dataset. The model leverages deep learning techniques to achieve high classification accuracy.

## Features

- **Deep Learning Model**: Built and trained a convolutional neural network (CNN) for image classification.
- **Data Augmentation**: Implemented data augmentation to improve model generalization.
- **Testing and Validation**: Conducted extensive testing and validation to ensure accuracy and robustness.
- **High Accuracy**: Achieved high classification accuracy through iterative model improvements.

## Dataset

The project uses the [Food 5K dataset](http://foodcam.mobi/dataset/), which contains 5000 images split into three sets: training, validation, and testing. Each set contains images labeled as either food or non-food.

## Installation

To run this project locally, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/food-image-classifier.git
   cd food-image-classifier


2. **Create a virtual environment and activate it:**
   ```bash
   python3 -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate   # On Windows, use `venv\Scripts\activate`
   ```

3. **Install the required dependencies:**
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

4. **Download the dataset:**
   Download the Food 5K dataset from [here](http://foodcam.mobi/dataset/) and extract it into the `data` directory within the project.

## Usage

To train and evaluate the model, use the following commands:

1. **Training the model:**
   ```bash
   python train.py
   ```

2. **Evaluating the model:**
   ```bash
   python evaluate.py
   ```

3. **Classifying new images:**
   ```bash
   python classify.py --image_path path/to/your/image.jpg
   ```

## Model Architecture

The model architecture is based on a convolutional neural network (CNN) designed for image classification. It includes multiple convolutional layers, pooling layers, and fully connected layers. Data augmentation techniques such as rotation, flipping, and zooming were applied to improve model generalization.

## Results

Through iterative model improvements and extensive testing, the model achieved a high classification accuracy on the test set. Detailed results and performance metrics can be found in the `results` directory.
